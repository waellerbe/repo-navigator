#### Introduction
This repo was created archive the knowledge I gather from resources here on GitHub. 

#### Purpose for the Name
The name of this README suggests that the information in this repo will help to "navigate" through a list of repositories that bring value to my experience with GitHub. In like fashion, my goal is to continue to look for opportunities to **contribute** multiple projects.

#### GitHub Language
A Markdown file will be created in this repo to explain some of the GitHub concepts with simple language. Some of the explanations in the document will have some poetic value. Creative language helps to transform technical jargon into terms that "make sense."

#### Future Collaboration
With this public repo, I welcome the feedback from GitHub users from coast to coast. In the beginning I would like to "give thanks" to incredible individuals who have created some of the most resource repositories here on GitHub. **Thank you** for your contribution to this Open Source Community.
